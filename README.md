# Reddit Clone Backend

## Overview
This repository contains the backend code for a Reddit clone application, built using Node.js and Express.js. The project demonstrates my skills in developing scalable and secure backend services, integrating various libraries and tools to handle authentication, file uploads, real-time communication, and more.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using bcrypt and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Image Uploads**: Efficient image handling and storage with Cloudinary and Multer.
- **Real-time Communication**: Implemented real-time features using Socket.io.
- **Data Management**: Robust data modeling and querying with Mongoose for MongoDB.
- **SEO-friendly URLs**: Generated clean and readable URLs using Slugify.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routing and middleware.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords.
- **Cloudinary**: Cloud service for managing image uploads.
- **dotenv**: Module for loading environment variables.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library for creating and verifying JWTs.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data.
- **Slugify**: Library for creating URL slugs.
- **Socket.io**: Library for real-time web applications.
